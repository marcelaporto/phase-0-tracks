# REFLECT
    
* What did you learn about pseudocode from working on this challenge?

    I learned that pseudocoding before each method, and inserting pseudocode before defining the method is really useful to make the method readeble.
    

* What are the tradeoffs of using arrays and hashes for this challenge?
    
    Arrays are good for making simple databases, but hashes are ideal when it comes to data that is connected with each other, that you can  access more easily.

* What does a method return?
    
    It returns the last line of code inside its definition, or anything that is called "return", since return is a forced output from the method.


* What kind of things can you pass into methods as arguments?
    
    Any kind of object you would like to work with inside the method. 


* How can you pass information between methods?
    
    Through global scope variables 


* What concepts were solidified in this challenge, and what concepts are still confusing?  

    I still have a lot to learn about hashes and scope, but I got much more comfortable in using methods with multiple arguments, and different type of arguments.
