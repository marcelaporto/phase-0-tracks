<h2>Desire Map</h2>
<h4>Lido: 23/01</h4>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>feelings can be true even though they’re not facts; </li>
		<li> Desire is the power of wanting. It’s an engine of creativity and a purposeful force. When we desire something, we’re willing to plot and plan to get it.</li>
		<li> Desire is something we act upon, and it’s something for which we make sacrifices.</li>
		<li>being told to focus often equates to ignoring our feelings.</li>
		<li> We all have core desired feelings. They stick with you for life. These feelings are the signposts we need to guide ourselves. </li>
		<li> “Feelings are magnetic. Each feeling is a beacon that attracts a reality.”
		<li> Many of us waste our time chasing what we think are our desires. But unfortunately, we’re simply chasing things that others desire for us. </li>
		<li> Knowing your real desires will help you chase the opportunities that really matter to you. </li>
		<li> A goal that you dread chasing isn’t a goal worth achieving. So, create goals that seem achievable to you, and capture your core values and desires. </li>
		<li> Make peace with the goals you want to achieve. Whether they’re fantastical or humble, if your goals make you feel good, then don’t criticize yourself for having them. </li>
		<li>you shouldn’t chase your goals while pretending these limitations don’t exist.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Your Best Just Got Better by Blinkist </h2>
<h4>Lido: 23/01</h4>

<ul>

		<li> Setting a clear goal takes self-honesty, which you can achieve just by standing in front of your mirror in the morning and asking yourself the following question: “If I could be better at one thing, what would that be?”</li>

		<li> Ask yourself another question: “What did I do today to bring myself closer to achieving my goal?”</li>

		<li> If you can turn your seemingly huge goal into a series of manageable tasks, taking action becomes so much easier.</li>

		<li> “A goal properly set is halfway reached.” – Zig Ziglar.</li>

		<li> Keeping pace is one way to use your day more effectively.</li>

		<li> Think about that the next time you’ve got 15 minutes to spare. Inconvenient waiting times can turn into windows of opportunity to tick those little items off our to-do lists. This in turn will free up mental space for more important tasks,</li>

		<li> A great way to evaluate your sense of purpose is by formulating some “So that...” statements. It could be things like “I work so that I can send my children to college.” You can keep these statements somewhere you’ll see them every day, to keep you inspired to achieve the things that matter.</li>
</ul>
