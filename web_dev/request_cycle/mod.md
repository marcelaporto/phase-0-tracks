Find at least five properties (in addition to the ones pointed out in the video) that might be interesting to change once the page is loaded

.innerText: changes the inner text of elements supported by it (buttons, text, not images)
.ondblclick: The event occurs when the user double-clicks on an element
.onmouseover: The event occurs when the pointer is moved onto an element, or onto one of its children
.onkeypress: The event occurs when the user presses a key
.onscroll: The event occurs when an element's scrollbar is being scrolled

If it is null in anny of these, nothing happens/nothing is in it.
