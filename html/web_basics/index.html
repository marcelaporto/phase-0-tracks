<h2> Reasons I like Beyoncé</h2>

<ul>
	<li> She is a <em>feminist</em> </li>
	<li> She has the voice of an angel </li>
	<li> She doesn't take foolishness from anyone </li>
	<li> She is strong, independent, sucessful, <em>and</em> a mother! </li>

</ul>
	<p> I guess women <strong>can</strong> have it all </p>

<h2> Beyoncé's Enemies, by order:</h2>
<ol>
	<li> Becky with the good hair </li>
</ol>

<p> Her enemies are <strong>my</strong> enemies (specially because she could take me down)! </p>
